# 🏦 Bank Transaction Analysis: Segmentation and Prediction

## Project Goal
This project explores a banking dataset to **segment customers** based on their transactions and then develops a **predictive model** for a key business outcome, such as high-value transactions or potential churn.



## The Data Source
* **Dataset:** `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection`
* **Description:** Contains over 2000 rows of anonymized customer transactions, including features like amount, transaction type, and time.
* **Preprocessing:** We created a feature engineering pipeline to convert raw transactions into behavioral features (e.g., average weekly spend, reliance on ATM).

## Analysis Roadmap (The Connection)

### 1. 🔍 Cluster Analysis (Unsupervised)
* **Notebook:** **Cluster Analysis (Unsupervised)** (See the navigation bar)
* **Insight:** K-Means clustering identified **three distinct customer segments** (e.g., "Wealthy Seniors," "Young Regulars," "High-Risk Customers"). These segments were added to the dataset as a new feature.

### 2. 🎯 Classification Model (Supervised)
* **Notebook:** **Classification Model (Supervised)** (See the navigation bar)
* **Goal:** Predict the **high-value transaction flag** using transaction features and the new cluster labels.
* **Result:** The Random Forest Classifier achieved an **F1-Score of 0.88**, demonstrating that the cluster feature significantly improved prediction accuracy.
